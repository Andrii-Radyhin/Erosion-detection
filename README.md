# Satellite-Segmentation
Abstract: this repo includes a pipeline using tf.keras for training Unet + EfficientNetb0 for the problem of erosion detection. Moreover, weights and trained model are provided. I will use EDA.ipynb as main file in EDA below, all images from output EDA.ipynb.

## EDA
Important to notice that we have dataset in .jp2 format (Satellite image), EDA.ipynb contains code using rasterio based on
